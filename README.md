# ECS 170 Final Project

By Zirui Zeng, Weichen Zhang, Xiangchen Kong, Hansheng Huang, & Lily Hu

The project uses a machine-learning model to classify mushrooms as poisonous or edible by identifying characteristics. The project will provide value to users by helping them recognize mushrooms and determine their safety for consumption.

We utilize machine learning which is the subfield of AI. The trained model will then be used to predict the classification of new mushroom instances based on their features.
